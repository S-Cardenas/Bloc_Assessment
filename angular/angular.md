##**Question**
Hey mentor,

I'm really excited about starting on learning Angular. I'm having a problem understanding what angular is. Up until this point we've used jQuery, which we've called a library. Now we are using Angular, which is a framework. What's the difference? What are the drawbacks/benefits of using a framework like Angular vs a library like jQuery?

##**Response**

Student,

The difference between a library and a framework can vary widely among the industry. There is no clear-cut
definition of what one is and the other isn't as the two words can be used very loosely in face-to-face and online-forum conversations. With that being said, here is a general definition from a leading site:

StackOverFlow.com:

>Library:
>
It is just a collection of routines (functional programming) or class definitions(object oriented programming). The reason behind is simply code reuse, i.e. get the code that has already been written by other developers. The classes or routines normally define specific operations in a domain specific area. For example, there are some libraries of mathematics which can let developer just call the function without redo the implementation of how an algorithm works.

>Framework:

>In framework, all the control flow is already there, and there are a bunch of predefined white spots that we should fill out with our code. A framework is normally more complex. It defines a skeleton where the application defines its own features to fill out the skeleton. In this way, your code will be called by the framework when appropriately. The benefit is that developers do not need to worry about if a design is good or not, but just about implementing domain specific functions.


A good analogy of library vs framework is music composition. Let's take for example Blues Music and the individual instruments that are used to create Blues Music (i.e. guitar, drums, bass, singer).

In this example, a library(ies) would be the instruments. The instruments can be used and called upon in the same way that methods and functions that you have written can be called upon. You can call/play them in any fashion and create any style/combination of music you want. jQuery has built in methods that can be called and can be used to create a web application in the fashion of your choice.

To create a Blues song however, you require a certain tempo, beat, key signatures, vocal styles, etc. There may be thousands of different blues songs, but they all follow the same framework/skeleton of music composition. In fact, if you wanted to write a blue song, the best method would be to find the instructions for the basic skeleton of a blues song. Frameworks like Angular are very similar to this. Frameworks are skeletons which define how your application will be set up and how it will function. They may have access to many libraries, like jQuery for example. All of the web applications made with a framework, like Angular, will follow the same design principles.

The advantages and disadvantages of using these libraries and frameworks stem from the type of application the user is trying to build. You want to choose the library/framework that will solve the problems your application will face. Frameworks are typically more complex and try to create much more complicated web applications. You would not want to build a highly complex website simply with jQuery. On the other hand, if your application is simple, then using Angluar would greatly complicate your workload as it is much harder to setup and execute than jQuery by itself.

At this point in your coding career it would be very difficult, although not imposible, for you to make a judgement call on when to use a library and when to use a framework. You will gain this ability by building more and more web applications and recognizing which tools best solve a partiucular problem.

If you have any further questions don't hesitate to ask me.

Best regards,

Stefan
